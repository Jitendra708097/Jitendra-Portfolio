## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Key Concepts

### 1. HTML
- **Purpose:** Provides the semantic foundation and structure for the website.
- **Usage:** All pages and components begin with HTML markup, arranged for accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.
- **Explanation:** HTML tags are used to define page layouts, heading hierarchy, accessibility features, and content organization.

### 2. Tailwind CSS
- **Purpose:** Powers the modern, responsive, and attractive design with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Usage:** Tailwind classes are embedded in HTML and React components to quickly style elements without writing custom CSS files.
- **Key Features:**
  - Responsive layouts out-of-the-box.
  - Dark mode and custom themes support.
  - Fast design iteration via pre-built utilities.
- **Explanation:** Tailwind enables rapid UI development and ensures a consistent design system. Styles are applied directly in the markup, reducing context-switching between HTML and CSS.

### 3. React.js
- **Purpose:** Handles component-based architecture and interactive UI logic.
- **Usage:** All pages and visual elements are React components, allowing for modular, reusable code and dynamic content rendering.
- **Key Features:**
  - State management for dynamic UIs.
  - JSX syntax for readable component code.
  - Props and hooks for logic and data sharing.
- **Explanation:** React enables building a scalable, interactive portfolio with fast navigation and efficient updates. It helps organize code, maintain features, and ensures a smooth user experience.
